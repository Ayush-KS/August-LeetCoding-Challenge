# August LeetCoding Challenge

This is a challenge by [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/august-leetcoding-challenge/) consisting of 31 daily problems over the month of August. A problem is added each day, and we have 24 hours to make a valid submission. I will be uploading my solutions in this repository after the deadline to make a valid submission for the given problem has passed.

I am going to change the language I code in every week!

Week One: Javascript
